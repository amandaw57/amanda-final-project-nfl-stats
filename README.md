# TAC 349 Final Project – NFL Offensive Statistics

This repository contains my final project for TAC 349, where I analyze NFL offensive player statistics from the 2019–2022 seasons. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate a complete data analytics workflow, including data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, analysis, and visualization.

I chose this dataset because I am passionate about football and closely follow the Denver Broncos. Using real NFL data made the project more engaging and allowed for meaningful comparisons between Broncos players and league-wide trends.

## Files Included
- `nfl_offensive_stats.csv`: Raw dataset used for analysis
- `amanda-wilson-finalproject.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook containing the full analysis workflow

The dataset was uploaded to GitHub to ensure reproducibility and easy access within Google Colab.
